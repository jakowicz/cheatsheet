# cheatsheet

I struggle to remember all the commands I need on a daily basis, so this helps me to remember. I also use [TLDR](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) which is great for when learning new commands. But, this package is meant for my top picks.

## Installation

First you need to install by brew tap, then install the package.

```
brew tap jakowicz/tap
brew install cheatsheet
```

## Usage

Run the cheatsheet.sh command (I'm going to remove .sh in the next release), pass one argument, which is the cheatsheet you would like to display. So for my "gpg" cheatsheet, you would run:

```
cheatsheet.sh gpg
```

The available cheatsheets includes: arp, arpspoof, dd, diskutil, gpg, growpart, netstat, python, resize2fs, shutdown, tcpdump, xfs_growfs
